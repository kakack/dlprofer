    Understanding GPU utilization and timing details of the operations is the
    first step in profiling your model.

        You will find resources on how to train networks with mixed precision
        and make full use of Tensor cores for Tensorflow models here:

        Note that if there are multiple kernels being observed on single op, 
        these are likely performing data transposes to prepare the data
        for efficient use by tensorcores. Such transposes themselves would not
        use tensor cores.
